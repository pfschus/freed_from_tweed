## Introduction

The goal of this series is to help you be an active participant in your career and maybe do something beyond the path set in front of you based simply on the degree you have earned. In this episode we walk you through a methodology for breaking down your existing skills and values and help you brainstorm possible jobs or careers that you are qualified for and interested in. 

Remember- you are a unique individual. It's common for people to adopt a role model and then strive to mimic that person in every way, and I see this quite often with PhD students who idolize their academic advisers. It's good to respect your adviser and want to learn from them, trying to emulate them exactly is selling yourself short. You bring a unique set of experiences that makes you valuable beyond just your adviser's research group, and today we will talk about recognizing your individual strengths that set you apart from the people around you. 

What are the end goals of today's episode?  
* I want you to be able to clearly articulate your skills in a few categories: technical, business, leadership, etc.  
* You should be able to clearly articulate your personal values, and rank them as high to low priority  
* You should be able to brainstorm a handful of possible career paths or professional roles that you are interested in and would be good at, in 3 categories: most direct path, a slight diversion, and a significant change.  
 
## Articulating your skills 
 
The first thing we are going to discuss is your existing skillset. It can be hard to recognize our own skillset and compare ourselves to the people around us, so I have a framework you can follow to make a comprehensive list.
 
First of all, let's discuss categories of skills. Generally, and since I mostly interact with students pursuing STEM degrees, we have two main categories:  
* Technical  
* Non-technical: business, leadership, social skills, etc. 
 
Another way of separating skills is by subject matter  
* Specialized- pertaining to a specific field of study or a specific industry  
* Transferable- skills that you can use across many fields.  

Now draw a "skills matrix" with two columns and two rows: 

![Skills matrix](/freed_from_tweed/docs/assets/images/skills_matrix_00.jpg)  

I will fill this out for the experience I had during my PhD program of working in a neutron generator facility and doing research on neutron detectors. I am going to break up all of the different activities I had into the four categories. 

![Skills matrix](/freed_from_tweed/docs/assets/images/skills_matrix_01.jpg)  

Now I will go back and try to break those activities down a bit further into specific skills. If you want to get a nice list of resume skills, you can look around online. [Here is an article from indeed](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/technical-skills) with a lot of examples. Do your best to include as much detail as you can. 

![Skills matrix](/freed_from_tweed/docs/assets/images/skills_matrix_02.jpg)  

Now I have a skills matrix for one experience. But I did a lot of other things in grad school and elsewhere in my life that will be useful in my career. So I will make a skills matrix for lots of different experiences:  
* Research in neutron detectors  
* Classes in public policy  
* Piano teacher for the girls down the street  
* Study abroad in Shanghai during undergrad  
* Any other experience, etc.  

Some of these may seem unrelated or too long ago, but at this point I am just trying to document everything. All of these experiences are useful and relevant, and you never know when you will stumble on an opportunity that is relevant to something you did a while back, that is no longer listed on your resume. I may find a job posting that I am interested in that requires frequent travel to a customer in Asia, and then I would want to showcase my study abroad experience, which would probably give me an edge over other applicants.  

You can organize these skills matrices in a few different ways. I like to open a powerpoint presentation and make one slide per experience. Zack wrote his on a piece of paper:

![Skills matrix](/freed_from_tweed/docs/assets/images/skills_matrix_zack.jpg) 
 
In the end, what are you going to use this matrix for?  
* Your task will be to market yourself for a job. You need to be able to explain objectively why you should be hired for this role, and back that up with evidence and examples.  
* Each role that you are interested in is going to ask for different skills. If you have all of your skills already organized and matched to the relevant experience, then you can quickly and coherently put together a targeted resume that is relevant to each position. (We will talk more about this in a future episode about applying for jobs. For now, just use this as a brain dump.)  

Be generous with yourself, include any little thing. Have you ever reviewed your lab mate's paper? Include that-- you have reviewed technical writing and provided internal feedback on a technical document. I think you will find it empowering to recognize that you have a lot of valuable experiences and transferrable skills!

## Recognizing your core competencies 
 
Core competencies are kind of a category within skills, and they are often personality traits that you already have by nature. To give you some examples, I found [a great list at 123test.com](https://www.123test.com/competencies-list/). Here are a few examples they give:  
* Attention to detail  
* Independent learning  
* Financial awareness  
* Entrepeneurship  
* Communication skills  
* Customer-oriented  
* Adaptability  
* Results-oriented  
* Data-driven  
* Critical thinking  
* Strategic thinking  
* Negotiating  
* Planning and organizing  

You can see that a lot of these are things that will be extremely valued by employers, and if you have certain core competencies, it may make you a natural fit for certain professional roles. At the same time, it may make you a bat fit for other roles. Your core competencies will set you apart from your peers, so you want to play them up in your career search. 

This is another area where it can be hard to identify your own core competencies, so you can rely on people who know you well to help you. Think about other people describe you, or what role you often take in a group settings. You can even show your friends or peers a list of core competencies and ask them which ones make them think of you. 

One resource for identifying your core competencies is the [Clifton Strengths Finder](https://store.gallup.com/p/en-us/10108/top-5-cliftonstrengths). This is an online test that you take (it costs $20 at the time of this writing) in which you will answer a huge number of questions where you have to indicate where you land on a range between two alternatives. For example, click on a line between "I prefer to work alone" and "I prefer to work with other people." It takes about a half hour to get through the questions. At the end of the test, you will get a summary of your top five strengths, which I compare to core competencies. For each strength, you will get a short summary and a detailed summary of what that strength means and how it can be applied in different career paths. 

Here is an example of my top five, when I first took the test in 2017 at the beginning of my post-doc: **Individualization, Connectedness, Learner, Arranger, Harmony.**

As an example of what information you get in the short summary, here is what it said about "individualization": 

* You recognize the unique qualities of each person  
* You have a gift for figuring out how different people can work together productively  
* You customize your interaction style for each person  
* Careers where this can be applied: counseling, supervising, teaching, writing human interest articles, or sales  

I related to this right away, and I find that this test is really good at capturing your individual qualities. And even if you've taken it in the past, it may be worth revisiting it and taking it again. For example, toward the end of my post-doc, I took the test again after I had done a lot of professional development, and my five strengths were: **Individualization, Connectedness, Learner, Maximizer (new), Strategic (new)**. This rang true to me and felt like an accurate evolution in my personal strengths. 

## Naming your values

In addition to recognizing your skills, you want to recognize what is important to you. Your values are the things that you care about personally and feel are important in your life and in your career. It can be almost anything, and you will probably have a ranking system within your list of values of which you prioritize over others. This list will likely change over the years as your life changes. Here is a list of examples:  

* Engaging work  
* Training and advancement opportunities  
* Ability to publish  
* Ownership of the work you produce  
* A high-energy workplace, or conversely, a relaxed workplace  
* Teamwork and collaboration  
* Independence, autonomy  
* Health insurance or other benefits  
* A specific salary  
* Work-life balance or work flexibility  

You can start by listing out the things you care about most, or you can find a comprehensive list of values online and categorize them as need, want, alright with, or don't care for. Often, when I am putting together my list of values, there are things that I appreciate in my current job that I forget about because I assume that will be present in every workplace, so I take it for granted. To make sure you don't miss anything, I recommend you take the next week to reflect on this and do the following exercise. This is a variation on an exercise from the book [Designing Your Life](https://designingyour.life/the-book/), which is a great resource and you should absolutely read. 
 
Here is the exercise:   
* Throughout your day, make a quick list of the various things you have done. Be detailed and include the little things. Here's an example: 
    * Took the bus to work  
    * Chatted with colleagues at the cafe  
    * Analyzed data  
    * Edited a paper
    * Helped my labmate plan his next measurement  
    * Presented in a group meeting  
    * Went to the gym  
    * Watched TV with my room mate  
* Beside each activity give it a little rating on a few things:    
    * How enjoyable was it?  
    * How engaged were you?  
    * Do you want to do more or less of it?  
    
Once you have some logs, you can start looking for trends. What was really engaging or enjoyable for you? What do you want to do more or less of? It may turn out that your morning chat with your colleagues in the cafe is really enjoyable for you, and you also enjoy helping your labmates plan their work, and that may mean that you should rank collaboration and interaction highly in your values. It may also mean that you value harmony, and you want to find a workplace where people get along, rather than a competitive or toxic environment.  

And don't forget the old adage, "you don't know what you have until it's gone." If there are parts of your current job that you really enjoy, make sure that you recognize them and include them in your values. 

In addition to your professional values, make sure you think about your personal values. That might be a location, proximity to family or friends, playing soccer a few nights a week, etc. I had one friend who loved going to hockey games, so he was ronly considering jobs in cities that have an NHL team. Your values will evolve throughout your life, so they are not set in stone. So just focus on what your values and priorities are right now and for the next 1-3 years. Remember: if your values change, you can always change jobs in the future.

## Identifying possible jobs
 
At this point, you have taken the time to map out your skills, your strengths, and your values. You have a general idea of what is important to you in a job, workplace, or career, and you know what you are capable of and good at. Now it's time to start brainstorming what career opportunities are available to you, either immediately with your existing skillset, or with a little bit of training in a new area. 

If we think back to our skills matrices, we want to look for subsets of skills that, when collected together, make up many of the responsibilities in a certain job or career. Then you want to think about environments where you can do that job and stay true to your values. For example, going back to my experience in the neutron generator lab and my values of harmony, collaboration, and teamwork, here are some jobs I can think of:  
* Experimental researcher at a national laboratory  
    * A direct extension of the work I was already doing  
    * The most "expected" role for me to take, based on my degree program  
    * I will call this the **most direct path**  
* Join a startup and help set up their lab spaces
    * Requires organization and individualization, which are some of my core competencies  
    * Important to build good rapport in a startup, which is one of my top values  
    * Different from my PhD work but I could definitely do it  
    * I call this a **slight diversion**  
* Organize a science camp for middle schoolers  
    * I have the science background  
    * I've done schedule coordination and worked with kids through my piano teaching  
    * Really different from my PhD work but a realistic option, especially if I needed a break from research or wanted to move somewhere without other career options  
    * This would be a **strong pivot**    

Spend some time brainstorming possible job titles. Here are a few ways for coming up with options:  
* Look up your old colleagues or graduates of your program on LinkedIn and see what they are doing  
* Make a bubble diagram, starting with main categories of jobs and then splitting them off into other fields or roles  
* Google some job responsibilities you are interested in, and look for job titles that include that in their posting  
* Instead of focusing on job titles, you may want to focus on industries or companies you are interested in, if that is easier, then investigate available roles within those  

## Conclusion

At the end of all of these exercises, you should have formulated a few summaries:  
* A skills matrix for each of your main experiences    
* Your top strengths and core competencies  
* Your personal and professional values, ranked by priority  
* A list of potential job titles, industries, or companies you are interested in  

These are all useful exercises, even if you already had a goal or career you are aiming for. Most people have never taken the time to articulate their strengths, values, and priorities, and you might find that the job you were previously aiming for doesn't actually align with what you need or want. It's really valuable to take the time to think through all of these things, especially if you can start early and give it some time. And remember to trust your gut in the process. 
 
What's the next step? The next episode will be focused on gathering information about each of those jobs, and then you can go back and forth between the information you gather, your skills matrix, and your personal values, until you zero in on a handful of roles that you want to pursue.
 
These exercises will be time consuming, but remember that this is an investment in your future. If you do the work now to really think through all of these things, it will pay back dividends in the future. So make time for this work. Set aside one evening a week, tell your friends you are busy, get your favorite takeout, and do the work. It's not going to happen for free.
 
The whole point of this podcast series is to help you be intentional, strategic, and brave in your career. Get out there and see what's possible and then make it happen!
