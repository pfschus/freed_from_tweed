## Introduction

The goal of this series is to help you be an active participant in your career and maybe do something beyond the path set in front of you based simply on the degree you have earned. In this episode we walk you through a methodology for breaking down your existing skills and values and help you brainstorm possible jobs or careers that you are qualified for and interested in. 

Remember- you are a unique individual. It's common for people to adopt a role model and then strive to mimic that person in every way, and I see this quite often with PhD students who idolize their academic advisers. It's good to respect your adviser and want to learn from them, trying to emulate them exactly is selling yourself short. You bring a unique set of experiences that makes you valuable beyond just your adviser's research group, and today we will talk about recognizing your individual strengths that set you apart from the people around you. 

What are the end goals of today's episode?  
* I want you to be able to clearly articulate your skills in a few categories: technical, business, leadership  
* You should be able to clearly articulate your personal values, and rank them as high to low priority  
* You should be able to brainstorm a handful of possible career paths or professional roles that you are interested in and would be good at, in 3 categories: most direct path, a slight diversion, and a significant change.  
 
## Articulating your skills 
 
The first thing we are going to discuss is your existing skillset. It can be hard to recognize our own skillset and compare ourselves to the people around us, so I have a framework you can follow to make a comprehensive list.
 
First of all, let's discuss categories of skills. Generally, we have two main categories:  
* Technical  
* Non-technical: business, leadership, social skills, etc. 
 
Another way of separating skills is by subject matter  
* Specialized- pertaining to a specific field of study or a specific industry
* Transferable- skills that you can use across many fields. 

Now draw a "skills matrix" with two columns and two rows: 

![Skills matrix](/freed_from_tweed/docs/assets/images/skills_matrix_00.jpg)  

I will fill this out for the experience I had during my PhD program of working in a neutron generator facility and doing research on neutron detectors. I am going to break up all of the different activities I had into the four categories. 

![Skills matrix](/freed_from_tweed/docs/assets/images/skills_matrix_01.jpg)  

Now I will go back and try to break those activities down a bit further into specific skills. If you want to get a nice list of resume skills, you can look around online. [Here is an article from indeed](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/technical-skills) with a lot of examples. Do your best to include as much detail as you can. 

![Skills matrix](/freed_from_tweed/docs/assets/images/skills_matrix_02.jpg)  

Now I have a skills matrix for one experience. But I did a lot of other things in grad school and elsewhere in my life that will be useful in my career. So I will make a skills matrix for lots of different experiences:  
* Research in neutron detectors  
* Classes in public policy  
* Piano teacher for the girls down the street  
* Study abroad in Shanghai during undergrad  

Some of these may seem unrelated or too long ago, but at this point I am just trying to document everything. All of these experiences are useful and relevant, and you never know when you will stumble on an opportunity that is relevant to something you did a while back, that is no longer listed on your resume. I may find a job posting that I am interested in that requires frequent travel to a customer in Asia, and then I would want to showcase my study abroad experience, which would probably give me an edge over other applicants.  

You can organize these skills matrices in a few different ways. I like to open a powerpoint presentation and make one slide per experience. Zack wrote his on a piece of paper:

![Skills matrix](/freed_from_tweed/docs/assets/images/skills_matrix_zack.jpg) 
 
In the end, what are you going to use this matrix for?  
* Your task will be to market yourself for a job. You need to be able to explain objectively why you should be hired for this role, and back that up with evidence and examples.  
* Each role that you are interested in is going to ask for different skills. If you have all of your skills already organized and matched to the relevant experience, then you can quickly and coherently put together a targeted resume that is relevant to each position. (We will talk more about this in a future episode about applying for jobs. For now, just use this as a brain dump.)  

Be generous with yourself, include any little thing. Have you ever reviewed your lab mate's paper? Include that-- you have reviewed technical writing and provided internal feedback on a technical document. I think you will find it empowering to recognize that you have a lot of valuable experiences and transferrable skills!

## Core competencies 
 
Core competencies are kind of a category within skills, and they are often personality traits that you already have by nature. To give you some examples, I found [a great list at 123test.com] (https://www.123test.com/competencies-list/). Here are a few examples they give:  
* Attention to detail  
* Independent learning  
* Financial awareness  
* Entrepeneurship  
* Communication skills  
* Customer-oriented  
* Adaptability  
* Results-oriented  
* Data-driven  
* Critical thinking  
* Strategic thinking  
* Negotiating  
* Planning and organizing  

This website also has a table farther down that gives examples of how these core competencies are useful in various careers, which can help you understand how these are relevant to your job search. 

These competencies set you apart from your peers and you want to be aware of your core competencies and play them up in your career search. This is another area where it can be hard to identify your own core competencies, so you can rely on people who know you well to help you. Think about other people describe you, or what role you often take in a group settings. You can even show your friends or peers a list of core competencies and ask them which ones make them think of you. 

One resource for identifying your core competencies is the [Clifton Strengths Finder](https://store.gallup.com/p/en-us/10108/top-5-cliftonstrengths). This is an online test that you take (it costs $20 at the time of this writing) in which you will answer 


### STOPPED HERE
 
This brings me to one of my favorite resources, the Clifton Strengths Finder test. This is an online test that you can take, it does cost money, but for me it was definitely worth the cost. Here is how it works:
You will answer a huge number of questions, like a hundred questions or more, and they are weird questions. Like they will present you with two things that may be conflicting and may not be, and you have to indicate which one you lean more toward
Some are easy, like do you work best alone or with other people?
Some are harder, like do you work best alone or like to be outside? That's not an actual question, but the point is that they want you to pick between two things that are not really opposite.
It takes a long time, like 20-30 minutes to get through all of the questions.
 
What do you get at the end of it?
For the basic test, you will get a set of your five top strengths. I would compare these most closely to core competencies. These are strengths that you have by nature or as a result of your experiences. Some you may have learned, but many of them are just part of your personality. Here is an example of my top five:
When I took the test in 2017: Individualization, connectedness, learner, arranger, harmony
For each strength, you will get a short summary and a detailed summary of what that strength means and how it can be applied in different career paths. For example, let's look at individualization
Recognize the unique qualities of each person
You have a gift for figuring out how different people can work together productively
You customize your interaction style for each person
They give recommendations for where this strength can be applicable: counseling, supervising, teaching, writing human interest articles, or selling.
Videos of people in different careers explaining how they use this strength in their role.
 
When I took the test the first time, I was really motivated by all of this content.
At the time I was in a research group where I felt I didn't belong, but I couldn't really put my finger on why not.
When I saw these five strengths named, I had an immediate sense of yes- I do have those strengths, and I am proud of them. And the people leading my team were not known for these strengths, so I understood why I felt out of place.
It helped me realize that the problem wasn't that the problem was that I did not fit into my research group, and in my case, that probably wasn't going to change.
It kind of took a weight off my shoulders because I had really been worrying that I was just not fit for the workforce, but the test results helped me recognize my strengths and map them directly to job responsibilities that I would be great at.
 
A few notes:
I think it is really good at capturing your individual qualities, and you may be surprised by it.
I had three of my undergrad students take the Clifton Strengths Finder test. I had worked with all three of these students and we made a pretty good team. I knew that they were all different, but I couldn't really articulate what was different about them.
When we took the test, they had vastly different strengths. The test named a lot of things that I couldn't articulate myself.  This made us a good team.
If you've taken it in the past, it may be worth revisiting it and taking it again.
 
In 2017: Individualization, connectedness, learner, arranger, harmony
I came into my postdoc wanting to be part of a team. I wanted to get on the train and contribute. Then I realized I didn't want to be on that train and I had to find a way off of it. I did a lot of professional development and took control of my situation.
In 2019: Learner, Individualization, Maximizer, Strategic, Connectedness
This says a lot- These were strengths that I developed through this process, and you can too.
 
VALUES --------------------------------
 
OK, so we have talked about the skills matrix, what are core competencies, and about the Clifton Strengths finder test. Those all fall mostly into the skills category, although the Clifton strengths finder test is what made me realize that I needed to identify my values, so let's talk about that.
 
Values are the things that you personally care about and feel are important in your career
Think about, if someone asked you "what are you looking for in a life partner," how would you answer that? I am looking for loyalty, kindness, fun, responsibility, financially responsible, etc.
This is the career-equivalent of that question. What do you want in your career?
It can be almost anything, in any category, here are some examples:
Engaging work
Training and advancement opportunities
Ability to publish
Ownership of the work you produce
A high-energy workplace, or conversely, a relaxed workplace
Teamwork and collaboration
Independence, autonomy
Health insurance or other benefits
A specific salary
Work-life balance or work flexibility
You can start by listing out the things you care about most. Or you can find a comprehensive list online and categorize them as need, want, alright with, don't care for.
 
I find it hard to name my values, because there are a lot of things that I value sort of philosophically, but then there are things that I value on a day to day basis without realizing it. Especially things that are present in my current job and take for granted.
So I would recommend that you take the next week to reflect on this and do the following
Throughout your day, make a quick list of the different things you have done throughout the day
Took the bus to work
Chatted with colleagues at the café
Analyzed data from yesterday's measurement
Edited a draft of my paper
Helped my labmate plan his next measurement
Presented in a group meeting
Went to the gym
Watched tv with my room mate
Beside each activity, give it a little rating on a few things:
How engaged were you?
How enjoyable was it?
Do you want to do more or less of it?
This is borrowed from a time tracking exercise in the book Designing your Life.
Once you have your logs, you can flip back through and revisit your values. It may turn out that you really love chatting with people at coffee breaks, and helping your labmate, which may mean that you should rank collaboration and interaction pretty high in your values.
That may also indicate that you value harmony, and you want to find a workplace where people get along, rather than a competitive or toxic environment.
 
Your values will probably evolve throughout your life, so they are not set in stone. So just focus on what your values and priorities are right now and for the next 1-3 years. Rest assured that if your values change, you can always change jobs in the future.
 
IDENTIFYING JOBS-------------------
 
At this point, you have taken the time to map out your skills, your strengths, and your values.
You have a general idea of what is important to you in a job, workplace, or career
And you know what you are capable of and good at
 
Now it's time to start brainstorming what career opportunities are available to you. Let's do some visualization.
You have a number of these skills matrices, and you also have a ranking of your personal values
Imaging that all of those are floating around in the air, and you are looking up in the air, and you see them sort of collect into little groups, and then float apart, and so on.
You want to start thinking about different collections and subsets of your skills and values, and how you could turn that into a job.
Just start making lists of jobs that you know about, at any experience level, that fit any subset of your skills.
For example, considering my neutron generator lab experience and my values of harmony, collaboration, and teamwork, here are some ideas:
Be an experimental researcher at a national lab. This is a direct extension of my same technical work
Join a startup and help set up their lab spaces. This plays on my organization skills, and my individualization strength because it's very important to build a strong team and good rapport in a startup. This is definitely different from what I did in my PhD, but I have a lot of relevant experience that would make me a competitive candidate.
Something really different- Organize a science camp for middle schoolers. Lab experience, coordinate schedules, and also from my experience as a piano teacher I have designed lessons before and worked with middle school aged kids. This is a big change from my current path, but it is a realistic option. And it could be that at this point in my life, one of my top values is moving back to my hometown to be near family, and maybe there is no industry there, but there is a lot of interest among the parents in having more STEM education. You just never know what opportunities will present themselves, and I really want you to be open to anything.
 
So I've just named three different path types. What I mean by that is, imaging you are moving forward on a road with all of your classmates, and there is this expected career path that people in your degree program will probably follow. It could encompass a lot of different things, but if you were to tell someone "oh I got a job doing this---" then they would respond with something like, that's great, congrats! With no surprise.
That's the first path type: the most direct path, you are staying on the highway, following a direct extension of what you are doing now. For me, that is being a national lab scientist.
The second path type is a slight diversion, like an off ramp, where you are going to go in a slightly different direction than what people are expecting. When you tell people what you're going to do, they will react with "oh yeah, that makes sense, I see how you could do that."
The third path is a significant change, you are stopping at the stop sign and turning left. A fancy word that people use for this might be "pivoting", which shows that it is intentional and strategic. When you tell people, they may be surprised or confused, or they may say "oh that makes perfect sense- you will be so good for that!" if they recognize your individual qualities.
 
How do you come up with job titles? My favorite thing is to look up on LinkedIn your old classmates or colleagues, or graduates of your program, and see what their job titles and employers are. Then google those and see what it means.
 
I like to visualize this as a tree diagram or a bubble diagram like you would make back in elementary school whenever you are brainstorming. Start with a few main categories of jobs that you know of, and just start splitting them off into other related fields or roles. And don't feel like you need to be comprehensive. You can start with just a few, because the next step is going to be gathering information about these roles, and that will lead you to learn about other roles that are out there.
 
CONCLUSION----------------------
 
SO that brings us to the end of today's discussion. Let's recap:
We talked about how to use the skills matrix for each of your experiences
We talked about core competencies and the Clifton strengths finder
We talked about identifying and prioritizing your personal values
And we talked about brainstorming some jobs that you might be interested in
 
I think these are all really useful exercises, even if you already know what your current goal is. Most people never take the time to name their values or recognize what skills and strengths make them unique and valuable. You may find that the job you thought you wanted doesn't really align with your current priorities, or that there is another job you haven't considered yet that would be even more exciting to you.
 
So what's the next step? The next episode will be focused on gathering information about each of those jobs, and then you can go back and forth between the information you gather, your skills matrix, and your personal values, until you zero in on a handful of roles that you want to pursue.
 
I recognize that all of these exercises will be time consuming, so remember that this is an investment in your future. If you do the work now to really think through all of these things, it will pay back dividends in the future. So make time for this work. Set aside one evening a week, tell your friends you are busy, get your favorite takeout, and do the work. It's not going to happen for free.
 
The whole point of this podcast series is to help you be intentional, strategic, and brave in your career. Get out there and see what's possible and then make it happen!
 
That is all for today- thanks Zack for being here.
