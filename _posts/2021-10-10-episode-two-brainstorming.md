## Introduction

The goal of this series is to help you be an active participant in your career and maybe do something beyond the path set in front of you based simply on the degree you have earned. In this episode we walk you through a methodology for breaking down your existing skills and values and help you brainstorm possible jobs or careers that you are qualified for and interested in. 

Remember- you are a unique individual. It's common for people to adopt a role model and then strive to mimic that person in every way, and I see this quite often with PhD students who idolize their academic advisers. It's good to respect your adviser and want to learn from them, trying to emulate them exactly is selling yourself short. You bring a unique set of experiences that makes you valuable beyond just your adviser's research group, and today we will talk about recognizing your individual strengths that set you apart from the people around you. 

What are the end goals of today's episode?  
* I want you to be able to clearly articulate your skills in a few categories: technical, business, leadership  
* You should be able to clearly articulate your personal values, and rank them as high to low priority  
* You should be able to brainstorm a handful of possible career paths or professional roles that you are interested in and would be good at, in 3 categories: most direct path, a slight diversion, and a significant change.  
 
## Articulating your skills 
 
The first thing we are going to discuss is your existing skillset. It can be hard to recognize our own skillset and compare ourselves to the people around us, so I have a framework you can follow to make a comprehensive list.
 
First of all, let's discuss categories of skills. Generally, we have two main categories:  
* Technical  
* Non-technical: business, leadership, social skills, etc. 
 
Another way of separating skills is by subject matter  
* Specialized- pertaining to a specific field of study or a specific industry
* Transferrable- skills that you can use across many fields. 

Now draw a "skills matrix" with two columns and two rows:

![Skills matrix](/freed_from_tweed/img/skills_matrix_00.jpg)  


* Example 1, technical: I studied neutron detectors in my PhD, and that technology was pretty specialized and mostly applicable to nuclear engineering or national security applications
Example 2, non-technical: I managed the neutron generator laboratory space at a national lab. That involved keeping up on the permits and maintenance for the equipment, working with radiation dosimetry people to approve the space.
Transferrable 1- general skills that you can use across many fields
Example 1, technical: But part of my work with neutron detectors was doing digital signal pulse processing, and that can be applied to any field where you are analyzing sensor signals. So even though I studied neutron detector output, I could very quickly get up to speed on data coming from other types of sensors. So I could market that work experience to a vast number of technical fields
Example 2, non-technical: As manager of the neutron generator lab, I had to coordinate time slots for all of the users, including over the weekend. That is a strong business skill, the prioritization, communication, scheduling, on call stuff, that many companies need help with so they can best utilize their resources. Also, I came up with our scheduling method myself from scratch, which shows something beyond a skill: a core competency. We will talk about core competencies in more detail in a minute.
 
So how can I organize all of the skills I have from this one experience of running a neutron generator laboratory and studying neutron detectors?
 
Create a 2x2 matrix.
 
Technical
Business
Specialized
 
 
Transferrable
 
 

Draw a grid with two rows and two columns
Label the columns: Technical skills, business skills
Label the rows: Transferrable, specialized
 
I am going to copy in the things I already mentioned from my neutron generator work in my matrix. Keep them short and concise. Split your experiences up into specific things.
 
Title: Neutron generator lab work
 
Technical
Business
Specialized
Neutron detectors- how they work, how to operate them
How to use a neutron generator to characterize a neutron detector
Managed a neutron generator lab space at a national laboratory
Kept permits and equipment maintenance current
Worked with radiation dosimetry people to approve the space
Transferrable
Digital signal pulse processing
Analyzing sensor signals
Coordinate scheduling for laboratory users
Prioritize projects, communicate with users, coordinate weekend on call
Developed the scheduling system myself

 
Right now it is more of an experiences matrix. We want to strip it down a little more to name the specific skills that you are utilizing.
 
(RESOURCE NEEDED)- need an online research with a long list of technical and business skills
Title: Neutron generator lab work, skills in red
Search for “examples of resume skills”--- Indeed has a lot of nice articles with examples
https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/technical-skills
	Programming languages
	Software design: Coding, debugging, test-driven development, object-oriented
	Productivity software applications: Salesforce, Jira, Zoom, Slack
	Project management: budget planning, risk management, task management
	Product management: Agile methodology, user experience design, product roadmaps

 
Technical
Business
Specialized
Neutron detectors- how they work, how to operate them, DT, DD, model numbers
How to use a neutron generator to characterize a neutron detector, scintillator detectors, photomultiplers, high voltage power source, again lots of specific information
Managed a neutron generator lab space at a national laboratory- user facility, national lab
Kept permits and equipment maintenance current- regulation, scheduling, responsibility, dependable
Worked with radiation dosimetry people to approve the space- internal collaboration, following safety protocol, safety culture
Transferrable
Digital signal pulse processing: MATLAB, python, C++ data acquisition, binary file parsing
Analyzing sensor signals, sensor characterization, anomaly detection, debugging and recovery, correcting for environmental effects
Coordinate scheduling for laboratory users- scheduling, coordination, managing expectations
Prioritize projects, communicate with users, coordinate weekend on call- communication, coordination, prioritization
Developed the scheduling system myself- (core competency), organized, fair, planning, logistics

 
So now we have a skills matrix for one experience. But I did lots of other things in grad school and elsewhere in my life that are applicable to my skills. So I am going to make a skills matrix for lots of different experiences:
Research in neutron detectors
Classes in national security public policy
Piano teacher for the girls down the street
Shows I can design a curriculum, individualize it to the student, juggle many different responsibilities
Study abroad in Shanghai during undergrad
International travel experience, international collaboration, specific knowledge of Chinese language and culture.
 
It's very unlikely that another student in my class has the exact same list of experiences. It's just not going to happen. All of these experiences are useful and relevant, even though some are far away from my PhD work, like the piano teacher.
 
You're going to make a skills matrix for each of these experiences. So you could organize it as a separate sheet in an excel document, or open a powerpoint and make a separate slide for each experience, or just put a bunch of tables in a word document. I will put an example template on the website for this.
Depending on how broad you want to be, you could just pick three different main experiences in your life, like maybe your PhD research, a recent internship, and a leadership position you have, or you could go on and on and have more than 20 different experiences that you break down.
It doesn't matter so much right now how you organize it, you're just trying to get as much down on the page as you can. You will come back through later and sift through it.
 
In the end, what are you going to use this matrix for?
Your task will be to market yourself for a job, imagine you are marketing yourself like a product. You need to be able to explain objectively why you should be hired for this role, and back that up with evidence and examples.
Each role that you are interested in is going to ask for different skills. If you have all of your skills already organized and matched to the relevant experience, then you can quickly and coherently put together a targeted resume that is relevant to each position.
We will talk more about this in a future episode about applying for jobs. For now, just use this as a brain dump.
Be generous with yourself, include any little thing. Have you ever reviewed your lab mate's paper? Include that, you have reviewed technical writing, provided internal feedback on a technical document.
 
I want to talk next about core competencies but before we do, Zack do you have anything you want to add about the skills matrix?
 
Zack's thoughts: Specialized non-technical
The hardest to pick up
Employers don't often value them
You'll pick it up on the job
You might not have anything here
 
Some will be harder to populate than others.
Start browsing job descriptions to get an idea. If there are skills or experiences listed in the job description, thing through your personal history, is there anything you missed that is relevant? Add it to your lists.
 
Do a few iterations on it. Start abstract and then get specific.
You have a lot more in your experiences than you probably think you do
Break it down by experience
 
It can be really empowering to recognize your transferrable skills. I have a lot of friends who have been in their jobs for a while, like more than five years, and they tell me things like, "I'm bored in my job, I'd like to look for something else, but who else is going to hire me to do photoresist development for lithography systems??" They think that they are now limited to opportunities that make use of their specialized skills, but actually they are competitive for lots of roles doing lots of different things but using your more generalized skills.
 
CORE COMPETENCIES -------------------------------------------------------
What is a core competency vs a skill?
 
Personal core competencies- these are sometimes personality traits that you have by nature just based on who you are, but some are learned
Google the phase "list of personal core competencies"- I found a great list at 123test.com https://www.123test.com/competencies-list/
Attention to detail
Independent learning
Financial awareness
Entrepeneurship
Communication skills
Customer-oriented
Adaptability
Results-oriented
Data-driven
Critical thinking
Strategic thinking
Negotiating
Planning and organizing
Sets you apart from the people in your class because they may not have the same qualities as you
Zack anecdote: Think about behavioral interview questions. This is what they are trying to measure.
We will talk about behavior interview questions in a future episode about what to expect in an interview, but they generally go like this:
Tell me about a time when….
You had to collaborate with a difficult partner?
You knew you were going to miss a deadline?
 
Farther down the page on this same website on 123test.com, there is a table that gives more detailed meaning of the competency and an example of a profession in which the competency is important. Here is their first example
Competency: being observant
Meaning: noticing and acting on signals given by people, organizations, and society
Example: You are quick to notice if there is something up with another person
Example of profession in which this competency is important: Therapist, bodyguard, trendwatcher, manager
 
This brings me to one of my favorite resources, the Clifton Strengths Finder test. This is an online test that you can take, it does cost money, but for me it was definitely worth the cost. Here is how it works:
You will answer a huge number of questions, like a hundred questions or more, and they are weird questions. Like they will present you with two things that may be conflicting and may not be, and you have to indicate which one you lean more toward
Some are easy, like do you work best alone or with other people?
Some are harder, like do you work best alone or like to be outside? That's not an actual question, but the point is that they want you to pick between two things that are not really opposite.
It takes a long time, like 20-30 minutes to get through all of the questions.
 
What do you get at the end of it?
For the basic test, you will get a set of your five top strengths. I would compare these most closely to core competencies. These are strengths that you have by nature or as a result of your experiences. Some you may have learned, but many of them are just part of your personality. Here is an example of my top five:
When I took the test in 2017: Individualization, connectedness, learner, arranger, harmony
For each strength, you will get a short summary and a detailed summary of what that strength means and how it can be applied in different career paths. For example, let's look at individualization
Recognize the unique qualities of each person
You have a gift for figuring out how different people can work together productively
You customize your interaction style for each person
They give recommendations for where this strength can be applicable: counseling, supervising, teaching, writing human interest articles, or selling.
Videos of people in different careers explaining how they use this strength in their role.
 
When I took the test the first time, I was really motivated by all of this content.
At the time I was in a research group where I felt I didn't belong, but I couldn't really put my finger on why not.
When I saw these five strengths named, I had an immediate sense of yes- I do have those strengths, and I am proud of them. And the people leading my team were not known for these strengths, so I understood why I felt out of place.
It helped me realize that the problem wasn't that the problem was that I did not fit into my research group, and in my case, that probably wasn't going to change.
It kind of took a weight off my shoulders because I had really been worrying that I was just not fit for the workforce, but the test results helped me recognize my strengths and map them directly to job responsibilities that I would be great at.
 
A few notes:
I think it is really good at capturing your individual qualities, and you may be surprised by it.
I had three of my undergrad students take the Clifton Strengths Finder test. I had worked with all three of these students and we made a pretty good team. I knew that they were all different, but I couldn't really articulate what was different about them.
When we took the test, they had vastly different strengths. The test named a lot of things that I couldn't articulate myself.  This made us a good team.
If you've taken it in the past, it may be worth revisiting it and taking it again.
 
In 2017: Individualization, connectedness, learner, arranger, harmony
I came into my postdoc wanting to be part of a team. I wanted to get on the train and contribute. Then I realized I didn't want to be on that train and I had to find a way off of it. I did a lot of professional development and took control of my situation.
In 2019: Learner, Individualization, Maximizer, Strategic, Connectedness
This says a lot- These were strengths that I developed through this process, and you can too.
 
VALUES --------------------------------
 
OK, so we have talked about the skills matrix, what are core competencies, and about the Clifton Strengths finder test. Those all fall mostly into the skills category, although the Clifton strengths finder test is what made me realize that I needed to identify my values, so let's talk about that.
 
Values are the things that you personally care about and feel are important in your career
Think about, if someone asked you "what are you looking for in a life partner," how would you answer that? I am looking for loyalty, kindness, fun, responsibility, financially responsible, etc.
This is the career-equivalent of that question. What do you want in your career?
It can be almost anything, in any category, here are some examples:
Engaging work
Training and advancement opportunities
Ability to publish
Ownership of the work you produce
A high-energy workplace, or conversely, a relaxed workplace
Teamwork and collaboration
Independence, autonomy
Health insurance or other benefits
A specific salary
Work-life balance or work flexibility
You can start by listing out the things you care about most. Or you can find a comprehensive list online and categorize them as need, want, alright with, don't care for.
 
I find it hard to name my values, because there are a lot of things that I value sort of philosophically, but then there are things that I value on a day to day basis without realizing it. Especially things that are present in my current job and take for granted.
So I would recommend that you take the next week to reflect on this and do the following
Throughout your day, make a quick list of the different things you have done throughout the day
Took the bus to work
Chatted with colleagues at the café
Analyzed data from yesterday's measurement
Edited a draft of my paper
Helped my labmate plan his next measurement
Presented in a group meeting
Went to the gym
Watched tv with my room mate
Beside each activity, give it a little rating on a few things:
How engaged were you?
How enjoyable was it?
Do you want to do more or less of it?
This is borrowed from a time tracking exercise in the book Designing your Life.
Once you have your logs, you can flip back through and revisit your values. It may turn out that you really love chatting with people at coffee breaks, and helping your labmate, which may mean that you should rank collaboration and interaction pretty high in your values.
That may also indicate that you value harmony, and you want to find a workplace where people get along, rather than a competitive or toxic environment.
 
Your values will probably evolve throughout your life, so they are not set in stone. So just focus on what your values and priorities are right now and for the next 1-3 years. Rest assured that if your values change, you can always change jobs in the future.
 
IDENTIFYING JOBS-------------------
 
At this point, you have taken the time to map out your skills, your strengths, and your values.
You have a general idea of what is important to you in a job, workplace, or career
And you know what you are capable of and good at
 
Now it's time to start brainstorming what career opportunities are available to you. Let's do some visualization.
You have a number of these skills matrices, and you also have a ranking of your personal values
Imaging that all of those are floating around in the air, and you are looking up in the air, and you see them sort of collect into little groups, and then float apart, and so on.
You want to start thinking about different collections and subsets of your skills and values, and how you could turn that into a job.
Just start making lists of jobs that you know about, at any experience level, that fit any subset of your skills.
For example, considering my neutron generator lab experience and my values of harmony, collaboration, and teamwork, here are some ideas:
Be an experimental researcher at a national lab. This is a direct extension of my same technical work
Join a startup and help set up their lab spaces. This plays on my organization skills, and my individualization strength because it's very important to build a strong team and good rapport in a startup. This is definitely different from what I did in my PhD, but I have a lot of relevant experience that would make me a competitive candidate.
Something really different- Organize a science camp for middle schoolers. Lab experience, coordinate schedules, and also from my experience as a piano teacher I have designed lessons before and worked with middle school aged kids. This is a big change from my current path, but it is a realistic option. And it could be that at this point in my life, one of my top values is moving back to my hometown to be near family, and maybe there is no industry there, but there is a lot of interest among the parents in having more STEM education. You just never know what opportunities will present themselves, and I really want you to be open to anything.
 
So I've just named three different path types. What I mean by that is, imaging you are moving forward on a road with all of your classmates, and there is this expected career path that people in your degree program will probably follow. It could encompass a lot of different things, but if you were to tell someone "oh I got a job doing this---" then they would respond with something like, that's great, congrats! With no surprise.
That's the first path type: the most direct path, you are staying on the highway, following a direct extension of what you are doing now. For me, that is being a national lab scientist.
The second path type is a slight diversion, like an off ramp, where you are going to go in a slightly different direction than what people are expecting. When you tell people what you're going to do, they will react with "oh yeah, that makes sense, I see how you could do that."
The third path is a significant change, you are stopping at the stop sign and turning left. A fancy word that people use for this might be "pivoting", which shows that it is intentional and strategic. When you tell people, they may be surprised or confused, or they may say "oh that makes perfect sense- you will be so good for that!" if they recognize your individual qualities.
 
How do you come up with job titles? My favorite thing is to look up on LinkedIn your old classmates or colleagues, or graduates of your program, and see what their job titles and employers are. Then google those and see what it means.
 
I like to visualize this as a tree diagram or a bubble diagram like you would make back in elementary school whenever you are brainstorming. Start with a few main categories of jobs that you know of, and just start splitting them off into other related fields or roles. And don't feel like you need to be comprehensive. You can start with just a few, because the next step is going to be gathering information about these roles, and that will lead you to learn about other roles that are out there.
 
CONCLUSION----------------------
 
SO that brings us to the end of today's discussion. Let's recap:
We talked about how to use the skills matrix for each of your experiences
We talked about core competencies and the Clifton strengths finder
We talked about identifying and prioritizing your personal values
And we talked about brainstorming some jobs that you might be interested in
 
I think these are all really useful exercises, even if you already know what your current goal is. Most people never take the time to name their values or recognize what skills and strengths make them unique and valuable. You may find that the job you thought you wanted doesn't really align with your current priorities, or that there is another job you haven't considered yet that would be even more exciting to you.
 
So what's the next step? The next episode will be focused on gathering information about each of those jobs, and then you can go back and forth between the information you gather, your skills matrix, and your personal values, until you zero in on a handful of roles that you want to pursue.
 
I recognize that all of these exercises will be time consuming, so remember that this is an investment in your future. If you do the work now to really think through all of these things, it will pay back dividends in the future. So make time for this work. Set aside one evening a week, tell your friends you are busy, get your favorite takeout, and do the work. It's not going to happen for free.
 
The whole point of this podcast series is to help you be intentional, strategic, and brave in your career. Get out there and see what's possible and then make it happen!
 
That is all for today- thanks Zack for being here.
